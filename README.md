# SECRET SKATE!

A user driven app that allows skaters to view secret skating spots as well as record their tricks.
Videos will populate the map where users can view the location and up vote the coolest trick. (Coolest tricks on top are shown with the most "ice cream points")

The theme of our project was unfamiliar environments. We chose to learn Ionic v1 for our mobile app. Other relevant and unfamiliar things were AWS S3_Buckets and ionic plug in's called ngCordova. S3_Buckets were used to store our video content and provide us with the video url. Given the URL we could view freshly recorded content. ngCordova was used to manipulate the video files (playback, view, record, pause, stop, etc...)


How To Use:
- Open app
- You may immediately choose a spot on the map and view a list of videos
  - From here, you can choose one video to view  
- Alternatively, from the home page, you may Log in to start recording a video
  - After logging in hit the record button.
    - After video is taken, let the page load, you will be redirected to a view page.
      - Your video is now posted!
